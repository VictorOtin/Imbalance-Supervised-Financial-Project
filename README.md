# Imbalance-Supervised-Financial-Project

In this hobby project a dataset with obfuscated features is given and the goal is to get the best score in test set. A clustering technique is used to learn correlated features and use this information to perform feature selection without substitution effects and after PCA and different models are used to learn a model with almost 90 % accuracy. A lot of techniques from Marcos Lopez de Pradosâ€™ books were used.
